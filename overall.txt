Here’s a concise walkthrough of how your program works, organized by responsibility and flow.

### High-level purpose
- Acts as both a seed server (serving file chunks to others) and a client (discovering files and downloading them from other seeds).
- Single bound port per run (from `[8080..8084]`), with background logging for both client and server.

### Key components
- **Config/Globals**
  - `PORTS`, `MAX_PORTS`, `CHUNK_SIZE=32 bytes` (in download), `CHUNK_DELAY_MICROSECONDS`.
  - Shared lists: `unique_files[]` (discovered files) and `active_download` (background download state).
  - Mutexes for thread-safe logs and shared state.

- **Logging**
  - Client logs: `download_file_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_port<myport>.log`.
  - Server logs: `seedapp_port<myport>_log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`.
  - Thread-safe via `pthread_mutex_t`.

- **Directory layout**
  - Each bound port maps to a folder ID \(1..5\).
  - Files served from: `files/seed<id>/<id>/...`
  - Downloads saved under: `files/seed<my>/<my>/<first-source-id>/<filename>`

### Startup and server
1. `main()` → `port_server()`:
   - Binds to the first available port in `PORTS`, sets `my_bound_port`, spawns the server thread.
2. `server_thread()`:
   - Loops on `accept()`.
   - For each connection, spawns a detached handler thread `port_request()`.

### Server protocol (handler)
`port_request()` supports:
- `LIST`
  - Returns this seed’s file list from `files/seed<my>/<my>`.
- `FILESIZE <filename>`
  - Returns `SIZE:<bytes>` for exact file bytes.
- `DOWNLOAD <filename>|<offset>`
  - Opens local file, seeks to `offset`, sends up to 32 bytes once, then closes.
  - This server sends exactly one chunk per request. The client connects again for the next chunk.

```566:584:D:\C++\DraftCodes\atonce.cpp
// Send one 32-byte chunk from the offset
char file_buffer[32];
size_t bytes_read = fread(file_buffer, 1, sizeof(file_buffer), file);
if (bytes_read > 0) {
    send(client_filehandle, file_buffer, bytes_read, 0);
    // logs "full chunk" vs "final chunk" if < 32
}
```

### Client menu flow
- `[1] List available files` → `listAvailableFiles()`
  - Connects to all other ports, sends `LIST`, parses results into `unique_files` (deduplicated).
- `[2] Download file` → `download_file()`
  - Lets you pick from `unique_files`.
  - Probes seeds that have the file (`scan_seeds_for_file()`).
  - Fetches exact size from one seed via `FILESIZE`.
  - Starts the background download thread.

### Background download thread
- Entry: `download_thread_worker()` → `download_file_round_robin()`.
- Round robin over `available_seeds`:
  - Maintains `total_bytes_downloaded` and `chunk_count`.
  - For each chunk:
    - Connect to current seed.
    - `send("DOWNLOAD filename|current_offset")`.
    - `recv` up to 32 bytes.
    - Append to output file, rotate to next seed, small delay.

```986:999:D:\C++\DraftCodes\atonce.cpp
snprintf(request, sizeof(request), "DOWNLOAD %s|%lld", filename, total_bytes_downloaded);
send(sock, request, strlen(request), 0);
// Read exactly CHUNK_SIZE bytes or until connection closes
while (total_chunk_bytes < CHUNK_SIZE) {
    auto bytes = recv(sock, chunk_buffer + total_chunk_bytes, CHUNK_SIZE - total_chunk_bytes, 0);
    if (bytes <= 0) break;
    total_chunk_bytes += bytes;
}
```

- The first successfully received chunk determines the download directory (based on the seed’s port → folder ID).
- Seed finishes when it returns a short chunk (<32 bytes) from end-of-file.
- Stops when:
  - `total_bytes_downloaded >= estimated_total_size`, or
  - All seeds are finished, or
  - Safety cap: `chunk_count > 10000`.

```1113:1117:D:\C++\DraftCodes\atonce.cpp
// Safety check
if (chunk_count > 10000) {
    log_client("Safety limit reached. Stopping download at " + std::to_string(total_bytes_downloaded) + " bytes");
    break;
}
```

### Progress and status
- Estimated total size from `FILESIZE` is set into `active_download` for status.
- `[3] Download status` prints `downloaded/total` with percentage (from `active_download`).
- Final logs currently say “100%” of downloaded/downloaded bytes even if it stopped early—so if the safety cap triggers, it will misleadingly show 100% of the partial file.

### Concurrency model
- Threads:
  - Main thread (menu/UI).
  - One server thread.
  - One background download thread (at most one).
  - Many detached handler threads—one per incoming connection.
- Shared state guarded by mutexes.

### Notable behaviors/quirks to be aware of
- Server sends only one 32-byte chunk per `DOWNLOAD` connection; the client reconnects for each chunk.
- Safety cap limits to 10,000 chunks ⇒ roughly 320,000 bytes max at current `CHUNK_SIZE=32`.
- The comment for `CHUNK_DELAY_MICROSECONDS = 5000` says “100ms,” but 5000 microseconds is 5ms.
- “Completed at 100%” log is relative to bytes downloaded, not file size; can be misleading on early stop.

If you want, I can:
- Rename/organize functions into sections,
- Extract protocol handling into a smaller server module,
- Fix the safety cap and “100%” reporting,
- Add inline docstrings for each function.
