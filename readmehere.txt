# Summary of atonce.cpp

## Core Functionality

This program is a basic file-sharing server application that:
1. Finds an available network port (8080-8084)
2. Binds to that port to create a server
3. Scans multiple folders for files
4. Displays a menu allowing users to list available files
5. Has placeholder functionality for downloading files (not implemented)

## Key Components Explained

### 1. Socket Programming

**What it does:**
- Creates network endpoints (sockets) for communication
- Binds a socket to a specific port number
- Sets up a server that listens for connections

**Key functions:**
- `socket()`: Creates a new socket endpoint
- `bind()`: Associates a socket with a specific port
- `listen()`: Makes the socket ready to accept connections
- `setsockopt()`: Configures socket options (e.g., allowing port reuse)

**How it works in this program:**
- Tests if ports 8080-8084 are available using temporary binds
- Permanently binds to the first available port
- Sets up a listening server on that port (though it doesn't actually accept connections)

### 2. POSIX Threading

**What it does:**
- Creates separate execution threads that run concurrently
- Uses mutexes to prevent data corruption when multiple threads access shared data

**Key functions:**
- `pthread_create()`: Creates a new thread
- `pthread_join()`: Waits for a thread to finish
- `pthread_mutex_lock()` & `pthread_mutex_unlock()`: Protect shared data

**How it works in this program:**
- Creates a single scanner thread to find an available port
- Uses mutexes to safely update the file list and bound port counter
- The main thread waits for the scanner thread to complete before continuing

### 3. File System Operations

**What it does:**
- Scans directories to find files
- Builds a list of unique filenames
- Manages file paths

**Key functions:**
- `opendir()`: Opens a directory for reading
- `readdir()`: Reads directory entries one by one
- `closedir()`: Closes a directory when done

**How it works in this program:**
- Scans all folders (files/1, files/2, files/3, files/4, files/5)
- Skips special directory entries ("." and "..")
- Maintains a global list of unique filenames
- Displays the list when requested by the user

## Program Flow

1. **Initialization**: Sets up global variables and data structures
2. **Port Discovery**: Creates a thread that tries ports sequentially until it finds one available
3. **Port Binding**: Binds to the first available port and sets up a listening server
4. **File Discovery**: Scans all folders and builds a list of unique files
5. **User Interface**: Shows a menu with options to list files, download files (not implemented), etc.
6. **Cleanup**: Closes sockets and destroys mutexes when exiting

## Key Design Patterns

- **Thread Safety**: Uses mutexes to protect shared data
- **Resource Management**: Properly creates and cleans up sockets and threads
- **Error Handling**: Checks for failures in socket operations and directory access
- **Modular Design**: Separates functionality into distinct functions

While the program has the structure for a complete file-sharing application, it currently only implements the server-side port binding and file discovery aspects. The client-side download functionality is present in the code but commented out and not fully implemented.
